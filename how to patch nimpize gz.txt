Patching nimpize steps:

Rom:
 - Have a nimpize rom and a clean 1.0 rom
 - Copy the nimpize rom for later (will be referred to as original nimpize)
 - Copy 0x5F60 bytes from 0x7430 in 1.0 to 0x7430 in nimpize
 - Copy the range 0x7430 to 0x75F0 in original nimpize to 0x7430 in nimpize
 - Patch this new rom with gz (make-rom)
 - Copy 0x5F60 bytes from 0x7430 in the original nimpize rom to 0x7430 bytes in the gz rom
 - Re-Calculate the rom crc

Wad:
 - Have a nimpize rom and a clean 1.0 rom
 - Copy the nimpize rom for later (will be referred to as original nimpize)
 - Copy 0x5F60 bytes from 0x7430 in 1.0 to 0x7430 in nimpize
 - Copy the range 0x7430 to 0x75F0 in original nimpize to 0x7430 in nimpize
 - Patch this new rom with gz (make-wad)
 - Use gzinject to unpack the wad and locate the rom
 - Copy 0x5F60 bytes from 0x7430 in the original nimpize rom to 0x7430 bytes in the gz rom
 - Re-Calculate the rom crc
 - Use gzinject to re-pack the wad
